            <h1>Can Agents Become Bigger Than SaaS?</h1>
            <p>
            Every decade, software quietly changes its shape. Not through hype cycles, 
            but through slow, irreversible shifts in how value is created. 
            This piece explores whether AI agents represent the next such shift.

            <h2>We See a Core Shift Every Decade</h2>
            <p>
            Foundational technologies don’t arrive every year. They arrive roughly once a decade, 
            and when they do, they unlock entire ecosystems of companies.
            </p>
            <p>
            The internet enabled websites. Cloud enabled SaaS. Mobile enabled apps. 
            Each shift looked unimpressive at first, then became unavoidable.
            </p>
            <p>
            Today, we’re watching a similar transition: artificial intelligence moving from 
            raw models to autonomous agents that act inside real workflows.
            </p>

            <h2>Pattern Recognition: Core Tech vs Wrappers</h2>
            <p>
            The same pattern repeats every time. Core technology is expensive, slow to build, 
            and controlled by a small number of players. Products and wrappers, on the other hand, 
            are fast to build and easier to monetize.
            </p>
            <p>
            Very few companies build operating systems. Millions build apps. 
            Very few build cloud infrastructure. Thousands build SaaS on top of it.
            </p>
            <p>
            Value is created when difficult technology is packaged into something that fits 
            a human workflow. That packaging, not the raw tech, is what users pay for.
            </p>

            <h2>Historical Parallels</h2>
            <p>
            In Web2, APIs and cloud infrastructure made it possible to build products quickly 
            without worrying about servers, scaling, or deployment.
            </p>
            <p>
            GitHub turned version control into collaboration. Notion turned documents into systems. 
            Canva turned design into drag-and-drop. None of these invented new primitives; 
            they combined existing ones into usable workflows.
            </p>
            <p>
            Web3 followed the same playbook. Blockchain enabled wallets, payments, DeFi protocols, 
            and developer tooling. The base layer mattered, but most value lived in the interfaces 
            and integrations people actually touched.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>AI Has Crossed the “Infra Is Ready” Line</h2>
            <p>
            For years, AI was impressive but impractical. Models were expensive, slow, and inaccessible. 
            That phase is over.
            </p>
            <p>
            Today, powerful models are cheap, fast, and widely available through APIs and open-source releases. 
            The infrastructure problem is largely solved.
            </p>
            <p>
            As a result, the opportunity has shifted. Winning no longer means building better models. 
            It means applying intelligence to real, messy problems inside existing systems.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Why AI Agents Feel Like the New SaaS</h2>
            <p>
            An agent is not just a chatbot. It combines intelligence with memory, tools, 
            and the ability to act without constant supervision.
            </p>
            <p>
            Traditional SaaS waits for input. Agents initiate actions. 
            They follow up on leads, update records, write code, monitor systems, 
            and make decisions within defined boundaries.
            </p>
            <p>
            This changes the mental model. Software shifts from something you operate 
            to something that operates on your behalf.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Wrapper Gold Rush</h2>
            <p>
            Right now, everyone is building agents. Sales agents that qualify leads. 
            Coding agents that refactor code. Support agents that resolve tickets. 
            Operations agents that monitor workflows.
            </p>
            <p>
            The barrier to entry is low, which makes many products look similar. 
            But low barrier does not automatically mean low value.
            </p>
            <p>
            The real differentiation is not in prompts or model choice. 
            It lives in how deeply an agent understands a workflow 
            and how safely it can operate inside it.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Where Real Money Will Be Made</h2>
            <p>
            Horizontal agents are easy to demo. Vertical agents are harder to build 
            and much harder to replace.
            </p>
            <p>
            An agent that understands healthcare compliance, financial reporting rules, 
            legal review processes, or production engineering constraints 
            becomes embedded into the business.
            </p>
            <p>
            In the long run, reliability beats novelty. 
            Trust beats cleverness. Ownership of workflows beats viral features.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>SaaS Isn’t Dead, It’s Evolving</h2>
            <p>
            AI agents are not killing SaaS. They are absorbing it.
            </p>
            <p>
            Tomorrow’s SaaS may look quieter and less magical. 
            It will feel boring because it simply works, 
            quietly executing tasks that humans used to manage manually.
            </p>
            <p>
            The biggest winners won’t feel like AI products at all. 
            They’ll feel like the obvious way things should have worked all along.
            </p>
